Yeah...yeah...one is based on selenium but you know it's even useful to get targeted album photos with opened firefox and cli; you just switch between two windows. Firstly you run python script in console then firefox is opened and one to click on targeted album and copy the link from search field of browser.
One should "pip3 install selenium", "apt install firefox-geckodriver" in debian-like distros or smth like that in other distros you know.
Limit of downloaded photos of each album is 56.
